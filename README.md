## Introduction

The threat landscape for Active Directory security continues to evolve at a rapid pace.
Well-known tools like [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) and resources such as [adsecurity.org](http://adsecurity.org/) have exposed and popularized numerous vulnerabilities that organizations must address.

PingCastle provides a streamlined approach to evaluating Active Directory security using a comprehensive risk assessment methodology and maturity framework.
Rather than pursuing exhaustive evaluation at the expense of efficiency, PingCastle delivers the optimal balanceâ€”identifying 80% of critical security issues while requiring just 20% of the time and effort of traditional assessment methods.
