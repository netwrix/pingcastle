* added mail notification option if mail is read & smtp credential on command line
* added "details" for rules which are difficult to understand without specifics

2.3.0.1 (cert-ist forum version)
* add the reachable mode (disabled by default, enabled by default if domain=* and used in interactive mode)
  This mode scans for domains outside trusts. Discover new domains when run on trusted domains.
* Reworked the domain maps for visualization and inclusing of the reachable mode data.
