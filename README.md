# Ping Castle

## Introduction

The risk level regarding Active Directory security has changed.
Several vulnerabilities have been made popular with tools like [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) or sites likes [adsecurity.org](http://adsecurity.org/). 

Ping Castle is a tool designed to assess quickly the Active Directory security level with a methodology based on risk assessment and a maturity framework.
It does not aim at a perfect evaluation but rather as an efficiency compromise.
